	<h1>Date and time formats used in HTML</h1>
	<br>
	Certain HTML elements use date and/or time values. The formats of the strings 
	that specify these values are described in this article.
	<br><br>
	Elements that use such formats include certain forms of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input"><input></a> element that 
	let the user choose or specify a date, time, or both, as well as the <a href=""><ins></a> and 
	<a href=""><del></a> elements, whose <a href="">datetime</a> attribute specifies the date or date and time at 
	which the insertion or deletion of content occurred.
	<br><br>
	For <input>, the values of <a href="">type</a> that return a <a href="">value</a> which contains a string 
	representing a date and/or time are:
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date">date</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/datetime-local">datetime-local</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/month">month</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/time">time</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/week">week</a></li>
	</ul>
	<h1>Examples</h1>
	Before getting into the intricacies of how date and time strings are written and 
	parsed in HTML, here are some examples that should give you a good idea what 
	the more commonly-used date and time string formats look like.

	<h1>Basics</h1>
	Before looking at the various formats of date and time related 
	strings used by HTML elements, it is helpful to understand a 
	few fundamental facts about the way they're defined. HTML 
	uses a variation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a> standard for its date and time 
	strings. It's worth reviewing the descriptions of the formats 
	you're using in order to ensure that your strings are in fact 
	compatible with HTML, as the HTML specification includes 
	algorithms for parsing these strings that is actually more 
	precise than ISO 8601, so there can be subtle differences in 
	how date and time strings are expected to look.
	<br>
	<h1><small>Character set</small></h1>
	Dates and times in HTML are always strings which use the 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> character set.
	<h1 id="#year_numbers"><small>Year numbers</small></h1>
	In order to simplify the basic format used for date strings in 
	HTML, the specification requires that all years be given using 
	the modern (or <strong>proleptic</strong>) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar">Gregorian calendar</a>. While user 
	interfaces may allow entry of dates using other calendars, the 
	underlying value always uses the Gregorian calendar.
	<br><br>
	While the Gregorian calendar wasn't created until the year 1582
	(replacing the similar Julian calendar), for HTML's purposes, the 
	Gregorian calendar is extended back to the year 1 C.E. Make 
	sure any older dates account for this.
	<br><br>
	For the purposes of HTML dates, years are always at least four 
	digits long; years prior to the year 1000 are padded with 
	leading zeroes ("0"), so the year 72 is written as 0072. Years 
	prior to the year 1 C.E. are not supported, so HTML doesn't 
	support years 1 B.C.E. (1 B.C.) or earlier.
	<br><br>
	A year is normally 365 days long, except during <a href="#leap_years">leap years</a>.
	<br>
	<h1 id="#leap_years"><small>Leap years</small></h1>
	A <strong>leap</strong> year is any year which is divisible by 400 or the year is 
	divisible by 4 but not by 100. Although the calendar year is 
	normally 365 days long, it actually takes the planet Earth 
	approximately 365.2422 days to complete a single orbit around 
	the sun. Leap years help to adjust the calendar to keep it 
	synchronized with the actual position of the planet in its orbit. 
	Adding a day to the year every four years essentially makes the 
	average year 365.25 days long, which is close to correct.
	<br><br>
	The adjustments to the algorithm (taking a leap year when the 
	year can be divided by 400, and skipping leap years when the 
	year is divisible by 100) help to bring the average even closer to 
	the correct number of days (365.2425 days). Scientists occasionally 
	add leap seconds to the calendar (seriously) to handle the remaining 
	three ten-thousandths of a day and to compensate for the gradual, 
	naturally occurring slowing of Earth's rotation.
	<br><br>
	While month 02, February, normally has 28 days, it has 29 days 
	in leap years.
	<h1><small>Months of the year</small></h1>
	There are 12 months in the year, numbered 1 through 12. They 
	are always represented by a two-digit ASCII string whose value 
	ranges from 01 through 12. See the table in the section <a href="#dotm">Days 
	of the month</a> for the month numbers and their corresponding 
	names (and lengths in days).
	<h1 id="#dotm"><small>Days of the month</small></h1>
	Month numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12 are 31 days long. Months 
	4, 6, 9, and 11 are 30 days long. Month 2, February, is 28 days 
	long most years, but is 29 days long in leap years. This is 
	detailed in the following table.

	<h1>Week strings</h1>
	A week string specifies a week within a particular year. A valid 
	week string consists of a valid <a href="#year_numbers">year number</a>, followed by a 
	hyphen character ("-", or U+002D), then the capital letter "W" 
	(U+0057), followed by a two-digit week of the year value.
	<br><br>
	The week of the year is a two-digit string between 01 and 53. 
	Each week begins on Monday and ends on Sunday. That means 
	it's possible for the first few days of January to be considered 
	part of the previous week-year, and for the last few days of 
	December to be considered part of the following week-year. 
	The first week of the year is the week that contains the first 
	Thursday of the year. For example, the first Thursday of 1953 
	was on January 1, so that week—beginning on Monday, December 
	29—is considered the first week of the year. Therefore, 
	December 30, 1952 occurs during the week 1953-W01.
	<br><br>
	A year has 53 weeks if:
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li>The first day of the calendar year (January 1) is a Thursday 
		<strong>or</strong></li>
		<li>The first day of the year (January 1) is a Wednesday and 
		the year is a <a href="#leap_year">leap year</a></li>
	</ul>
	All other years have 52 weeks.

	<h1 id="#month_string">Month strings</h1>
	A month string represents a specific month in time, rather than a generic month of the year. That is, rather than representing "January," an HTML month string represents a month and year paired, like "January 1972."
	<br><br>
	A valid month string consists of a valid <a href="">year number</a> (a string of at least four digits), followed by a hyphen character ("-", or U+002D), followed by a two-digit numeric <a href="">month number</a>, where 01 represents January and 12 represents December.

	<h1>Time strings</h1>
	A time string can specify a time with precision to the minute, 
	second, or to the millisecond. Specifying only the hour or 
	minute isn't permitted. A <strong>valid</strong> time string minimally consists of 
	a two-digit hour followed by a colon (":", U+003A), then a 
	two-digit minute. The minute may optionally be followed by 
	another colon and a two-digit number of seconds. Milliseconds 
	may be specified, optionally, by adding a decimal point 
	character (".", U+002E) followed by one, two, or three digits.
	<br><br>
	There are some additional basic rules:
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li>The hour is always specified using the 24-hour clock, with 
		00 being midnight and 11 PM being 23. No values outside 
		the range 00–23 are permitted.</li>
		<li>The minute must be a two-digit number between 00 and 
		59. No values outside that range are allowed.</li>
		<li>If the number of seconds is omitted (to specify a time 
		accurate only to the minute), no colon should follow the 
		number of minutes.</li>
		<li>If specified, the integer portion of the number of seconds 
		must be between 00 and 59. You cannot specify leap seconds by 
		using values like 60 or 61.</li>
		<li>If the number of seconds is specified and is an integer, it 
		must not be followed by a decimal point.</li>
		<li>If a fraction of a second is included, it may be from one to 
		three digits long, indicating the number of milliseconds. It 
		follows the decimal point placed after the seconds component 
		of the time string.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse;">
		<tr>
			<th>Time string</th>	
			<th>Time</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>00:00:30.75</td>	
			<td>12:00:30.75 AM (30.75 seconds after midnight)</td>

	<h1>Local date and time strings</h1>
	A valid <a href="">datetime-local</a> string consists of a date string and a 
	time string concatenated together with either the letter "T" or 
	a space character separating them. No information about the 
	time zone is included in the string; the date and time is 
	presumed to be in the user's local time zone.
	<br><br>
	When you set the <a href="">value</a> of a datetime-local input, the string 
	is <strong>normalized</strong> into a standard form. Normalized datetime 
	strings always use the letter "T" to separate the date and 
	the time, and the time portion of the string is as short as 
	possible. This is done by leaving out the seconds component 
	if its value is :00.
	<br><br>
	<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse;">

		<tr>

			<td>0170-07-31T22:00
			<br>Note that the normalized form of this date drops the ":00" indicating the number of seconds to be zero, because the seconds are optional when zero, and the normalized string minimizes the length of the string.</td>

	<h1>Global date and time strings</h1>
	A global date and time string specifies a date and time as well as the time zone in which it occurs. A <strong>valid global date and time string</strong> is the same format as a <a href="">local date and time string</a>, except it has a time zone string appended to the end, following the time.
	<br>
	<h1><small>Time zone offset string</small></h1>
	A time zone offset string specifies the offset in either a positive or a negative number of hours and minutes from the standard time base. There are two standard time bases, which are very close to the same, but not exactly the same:
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li>For dates after the establishment of <a href="">Coordinated Universal Time</a> (UTC) in the early 1960s, the time base is Z and the offset indicates a particular time zone's offset from the time at the prime meridian at 0º longitude (which passes through the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, England).</li>
		<li>For dates prior to UTC, the time base is instead expressed in terms of <a href="">UT1</a>, which is the contemporary Earth solar time at the prime meridian.</li>
	</ul>
	The time zone string is appended immediately following the time in the date and time string. You can specify "Z" as the time zone offset string to indicate that the time is specified in UTC. Otherwise, the time zone string is constructed as follows:
	<ol>
		<li>A character indicating the sign of the offset: the plus character ("+", or U+002B) for time zones to the east of the prime meridian or the minus character ("-", or U+002D) for time zones to the west of the prime meridian.</li>
		<li>A two-digit number of hours that the time zone is offset from the prime meridian. This value must be between 00 and 23.</li>
		<li>An optional colon (":") character.</li>
		<li>A two-digit number of minutes past the hour; this value must be between 00 and 59.</li>
	</ol>
	While this format allows for time zones between -23:59 and +23:59, the current range of time zone offsets is -12:00 to +14:00, and no time zones are currently offset from the hour by anything other than 00, 30, or 45 minutes. This may change at more or less anytime, since countries are free to tamper with their time zones at any time and in any way they wish to do so.
